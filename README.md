# spark-apache-delta

This project will attempt to simulate real world use cases in terms of revision history and new records which need to be upserted into a database. We will test the features and functionality of Apache Delta. 


This project relies on the python from within your venv, in the base directory of the repo (not included with repo, use whatever python version you like)

Loosely based on a talk at the 2020 Spark+AI Summit titled "
Delta From A Data Engineer's Perspective"
